My name is Sergio Sánchez Zavala and I’m originally from Tijuana, Baja California, México. I’m dedicated to making research transparent and reproducible. I’m a public policy wonk + data and tech nerd. I like making accessible and reproducible open-sourced tools and resources 🤓

I’m also:

🧑🏼‍🎨🧑🏼‍🏫 a facilitator in the newly formed Data Visualization Society.

🌮📊 the creator of @tacosdedatos - tacosdedatos.com where I hope to build a place to learn data analysis and data visualization best practices, techniques, and knowledge in Spanish.

🧑🏼‍🔬🎨 and a data visualization analyst at Alluma - a social enterprise in the social tech space.
